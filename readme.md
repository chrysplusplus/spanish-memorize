# Spanish Memorize

A tool to help with learning Spanish vocabulary, coded in python

## Installation

This project currently requires no further dependencies other than python.

Clone the repository or download the zip file to your local machine. In the
terminal, run the following command:

```
$ python3 memorize.py
```

Windows users will have to use this command:

```
> python memorize.py
```

I will be working on this semi-frequently, so expect changes to the program
layout and data files. But in the meantime, enjoy! I have play-tested this a
little and it hasn't broken on me yet.

Let me know if you have any issues.

## Language Support

The program is coded so that it isn't limited to Spanish and English. Feel free
to expand the data files in `memorize_files` or add your own.
